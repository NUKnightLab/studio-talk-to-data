"It had been weeks since Chicago had seen rain, so the wind-blown mist that tumbled out of the heather skies on October 11 felt like a cop-out for what should have poured down from the heavens.

One of the security guards, Mike DeVane, leaned over. “Were you here yesterday?” the clean-cut, red faced, portly officer asked. I shook my head. “I’ve never seen anything like it,” he said, “The entire lobby was packed.” 

He told me that the proceedings dragged on for six hours because of the number of public speakers. “People have been sick of these taxes for a while; something had to be the final straw,” he said. “I guess it was soda.”"
